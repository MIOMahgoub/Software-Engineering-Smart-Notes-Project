Our goal is to create a functional application that improves the effectiveness of the user 
studying their notes. This application would implement natural language processing to 
help summarize uploaded notes and generate flashcards and quizzes to help the user 
develop proficiency in their subjects. This analyzer will also integrate the information of 
the material to generate quizzes for users to test their knowledge and determine where 
they are in terms of their knowledge. The user will be able to track their quiz 
performance over time and monitor their growth and mastery of the material.
